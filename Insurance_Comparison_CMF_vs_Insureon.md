## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Can we mix and match? (e.g., CM&F for professional liability, Insureon for workers comp)**

A: Yes, but you'll lose multi-policy discounts. Best to get all quotes, then decide if unbundling saves money. Typically, bundling with one carrier saves 10-15%.

---

**Q: Which company has better claims service?**

A: CM&F likely has edge due to healthcare specialization and A++ rating. Insureon's claims service depends on which carrier you select. Ask Insureon which of their 40+ carriers has best healthcare claims reputation.

---

**Q: Do we really need cyber insurance?**

A: **Yes, highly recommended** for home health agencies because:
- You store Protected Health Information (PHI)
- HIPAA fines are severe ($50K per violation)
- Ransomware targets healthcare (easy targets, pay quickly)
- Breach notification costs are expensive
- Many professional liability policies exclude cyber claims

---

**Q: What if CM&F is more expensive?**

A: Consider value, not just price:
- Higher limits ($2M vs $1M) = more protection
- Unlimited legal defense = could save tens of thousands
- Healthcare expertise = better claims outcomes
- A++ rating = 99.9% chance they'll pay claims
- If difference is $500-$1,000/year, CM&F may be worth it

---

**Q: How quickly do we need coverage?**

A: Insurance should be in place **before you provide any services**. Timeline:
- Insureon: Can bind coverage same day
- CM&F: 3-7 days from application to binding

**Recommendation:** Start quote process 2-3 weeks before go-live date.

---

**Q: What about E&O (Errors & Omissions) insurance?**

A: For healthcare, "Professional Liability" and "E&O" are essentially the same. Both CM&F and Insureon's professional liability policies cover errors and omissions in your nursing care.

---

**Q: Can we add employees later?**

A: Yes, both allow mid-term additions. With CM&F, notify them directly. With Insureon, depends on carrier selected but generally easy. Workers comp automatically adjusts at year-end audit (or monthly if pay-as-you-go).

---

**Q: What happens if we have a claim?**

A:
- **CM&F:** Call dedicated healthcare claims team → Assigned specialized adjuster → Legal defense if needed → Resolution
- **Insureon:** Call carrier's claims line (varies by carrier) → Standard claims process → Legal defense if needed → Resolution

CM&F's advantage: Healthcare-specific claims expertise from day one.

---

**Q: Is tail coverage important?**

A: **Yes, if you have claims-made policy** (vs occurrence). Tail coverage protects you from claims filed after policy ends for incidents that occurred while covered. CM&F clearly offers this; ask Insureon carriers if they do. Budget ~$1,500-$3,000 for tail when switching carriers or closing business.
