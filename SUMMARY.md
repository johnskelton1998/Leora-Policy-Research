## Frequently Asked Questions

### Safety Program

**Q: How long does new employee safety training take?**
A: 12-17 hours total before first patient contact. This includes general safety (2-3 hrs), bloodborne pathogen training (1-2 hrs), patient handling with hands-on practice (2-3 hrs), driving safety (1 hr), and CPR/First Aid certification (4-6 hrs).

**Q: What happens if an employee reports an injury?**
A: 1) Provide immediate medical care if needed, 2) Report to supervisor same day, 3) Complete incident report within 24 hours, 4) Employer reports to workers comp carrier within 24 hours, 5) Employee seeks treatment at designated provider, 6) Modified duty offered if restrictions allow work.

**Q: Are employees disciplined for reporting injuries?**
A: Never. Reporting injuries and safety concerns is a protected right. Employees will not face retaliation or discipline for reporting injuries, near-misses, or hazards.

**Q: What if an employee feels a client's home is unsafe?**
A: Employees have the right to refuse unsafe work. If hazards cannot be immediately corrected, the employee should leave the premises, notify the supervisor, and document the situation. Services may be modified or suspended until hazards are addressed.

### Workers Compensation Insurance

**Q: How much will workers compensation insurance cost for Leora Home Health?**
A: For 3 employees in home health care (NCCI Code 8835), expect $1,100-$2,400 annually depending on carrier. Pay-as-you-go options run $85-140/month. Texas Mutual offers best net cost after dividends (~$900-$1,200 net).

**Q: What's the difference between traditional and pay-as-you-go workers comp?**
A: Traditional requires 25% down payment and 9 monthly installments based on estimated payroll, with annual audit. Pay-as-you-go automatically calculates premium each payroll period based on actual wages, requires $0 down, and has no year-end audit. PAYG is ideal for small businesses with limited cash flow.

**Q: Why is Texas Mutual recommended?**
A: Texas Mutual is the state fund that cannot refuse coverage (guaranteed issue), has paid dividends 18 consecutive years averaging 35%, offers free loss control services, and provides fast quote turnaround. While not always the cheapest upfront, the dividend history makes it very competitive on net cost.

**Q: Should Leora Home Health use a broker or buy direct?**
A: Both options are valid. Brokers provide comparison shopping across multiple carriers at no cost to you (commission paid by carrier) and offer ongoing support. Direct purchase can be faster and allows direct relationship with carrier. Recommended: Get quotes both ways to compare.

**Q: When should workers comp coverage start?**
A: Coverage must be in place before the first employee performs any work. For Leora Home Health, start the quote process 3-4 weeks before needing coverage to allow time for shopping, comparison, and binding.
