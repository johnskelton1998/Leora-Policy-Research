## 3. PATIENT HANDLING AND LIFTING SAFETY

### Purpose

To prevent back injuries, strains, and other musculoskeletal injuries related to patient handling and lifting activities.

### Scope

This policy applies to all employees who provide direct patient care involving lifting, transferring, repositioning, or ambulating patients.

### Policy Statement

Leora Home Health recognizes that patient handling is the #1 cause of injuries in home health care. We are committed to preventing these injuries through proper techniques, equipment, and training.

### General Safe Patient Handling Principles

**NEVER lift or transfer a patient alone if:**
- Patient weighs more than 50 pounds and requires full lift
- Patient is unable to bear weight
- Patient has unpredictable behavior
- Patient has a history of falling
- You feel uncomfortable or unsafe

**ALWAYS:**
- Assess patient's mobility level before attempting transfer
- Use mechanical lifts when available
- Request assistance when needed
- Maintain good body mechanics
- Communicate clearly with patient during transfer

### Body Mechanics Best Practices

1. **Plan Ahead**
   - Assess the patient's ability to assist
   - Clear the path of obstacles
   - Position equipment before starting
   - Ensure adequate lighting

2. **Proper Stance**
   - Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
   - Keep one foot slightly ahead of the other
   - Bend at the knees, not the waist
   - Keep your back straight

3. **During the Lift**
   - Hold the patient close to your body
   - Use your leg muscles to lift, not your back
   - Avoid twisting while lifting
   - Pivot your feet to turn
   - Move slowly and smoothly

4. **Communication**
   - Explain what you're going to do
   - Give clear instructions to the patient
   - Count "1, 2, 3" before lifting
   - Ask patient to notify you of pain or dizziness

### Transfer Techniques by Patient Mobility Level

#### Level 1: Independent (No Assistance Needed)
- **Description:** Patient can safely transfer without help
- **Caregiver Role:** Standby supervision only
- **Equipment:** None required
- **Technique:** Allow patient to perform transfer; watch for safety

#### Level 2: Minimal Assistance (Patient Bears Most Weight)
- **Description:** Patient needs minor help with balance or guidance
- **Caregiver Role:** Light touch for guidance and confidence
- **Equipment:** Gait belt recommended
- **Technique:**
  1. Apply gait belt securely around patient's waist
  2. Stand to patient's weak side if applicable
  3. Allow patient to do the work
  4. Provide stability and verbal cues

#### Level 3: Moderate Assistance (Patient Bears Some Weight)
- **Description:** Patient can help but needs significant support
- **Caregiver Role:** Provide substantial physical assistance
- **Equipment:** Gait belt required; consider transfer board
- **Technique:**
  1. Apply gait belt
  2. Position yourself properly
  3. Rock patient forward to standing position
  4. Pivot together to destination
  5. Lower slowly into seat
  - **Two-person assist may be needed**

#### Level 4: Maximum Assistance (Patient Bears Little Weight)
- **Description:** Patient can provide minimal help
- **Caregiver Role:** Perform most of the work
- **Equipment:** Gait belt required; mechanical lift strongly recommended
- **Technique:**
  - **STOP:** Assess if mechanical lift is needed
  - **ALWAYS use two-person assist**
  - Consider whether transfer is necessary or can be delayed until appropriate equipment is available

#### Level 5: Total Assistance (Patient Cannot Help)
- **Description:** Patient cannot bear weight or assist
- **Caregiver Role:** Full mechanical lift required
- **Equipment:** Hoyer lift or similar mechanical lift device
- **Technique:**
  - **DO NOT attempt manual lift**
  - Use mechanical lift according to manufacturer instructions
  - Two-person assist required for safety
  - If lift not available, reschedule non-essential transfers or request equipment

### Required Transfer Equipment

**Gait Belts:**
- Must be available for all patient transfers (Level 2-4)
- Proper width: 2 inches minimum
- Apply snugly around waist, not chest or abdomen
- Check for wear and tear before each use

**Transfer Boards (Sliding Boards):**
- Use for bed-to-chair or chair-to-chair transfers
- Good for patients who cannot stand but can sit
- Reduces caregiver lifting force

**Mechanical Lifts (Hoyer Lifts):**
- Required for patients who cannot bear weight (Level 5)
- Two caregivers required for operation
- Training required before use
- Annual recertification
- Coordinate with patient/family to ensure lift is available in home

### Client Home Assessment for Safe Transfers

Before first visit, assess:
- [ ] Is bed height appropriate? (knee-height ideal)
- [ ] Are chairs stable and have arms?
- [ ] Is wheelchair in good working condition?
- [ ] Is there adequate space for safe transfers?
- [ ] Is floor surface non-slip?
- [ ] Is lighting adequate?
- [ ] Are there grab bars in bathroom?

- [ ] Are there obstacles that need to be moved?

**Document assessment in patient care plan.**

### Two-Person Lift Requirements

**Two caregivers are required when:**
- Patient weighs over 150 pounds and needs moderate-to-maximum assistance
- Patient has history of falls or unpredictable movements
- Patient is unable to follow directions
- Patient requires transfer in cramped or awkward space
- Single caregiver feels unsafe performing transfer alone

**Procedure:**
1. Designate one caregiver as "lead" who gives instructions
2. Both caregivers review plan before starting
3. Use count of "1, 2, 3" to coordinate movement
4. Lead caregiver provides verbal cues throughout
5. Either caregiver can call "STOP" if they feel unsafe

### Prohibited Practices

**NEVER:**
- Lift a patient by grasping under their arms (axilla)
- Twist your spine while lifting or holding a patient
- Lift a patient who exceeds your capability alone
- Rush a transfer
- Transfer a patient without proper assessment
- Attempt transfer if patient is non-compliant or combative
- Use broken or defective equipment

### Special Considerations

**Bariatric Patients (over 300 lbs):**

- Specialized equipment may be required
- Consult with clinical supervisor before first visit

**Patients with Dementia/Confusion:**
- Approach from front where patient can see you
