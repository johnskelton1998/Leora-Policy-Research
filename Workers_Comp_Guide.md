| **Pay-As-You-Go** | $0 | Varies with payroll | No | Cash flow, avoiding audit |

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can we be declined for coverage?**
A: Most carriers can decline if they consider your business too risky. **Texas Mutual cannot decline** (state fund) - that's why it's recommended as baseline option.

**Q: What if we have a claim in first year?**
A: Claims are covered per your policy. Rate may increase at renewal depending on severity. One minor claim often won't dramatically affect rates.

**Q: Do we need coverage if we're just starting and haven't hired yet?**
A: Coverage must be in place **before first employee performs any work**. Start quote process 3-4 weeks before first hire date.

**Q: Can we add employees mid-year?**
A: Yes! Notify carrier to add employees. With traditional plan, payroll audit at year-end will account for changes. With PAYG, it's automatic.

**Q: What's the difference between broker and agent?**
A: **Broker** represents you (buyer), can shop multiple carriers. **Agent** represents specific carrier(s). Both are paid by insurance company, not you.

**Q: Should we include owners in coverage?**
A: In Texas, sole proprietors and partners can elect coverage (optional). Corporate officers are automatically included unless formally excluded. Recommended to include owners for protection.

**Q: What if employee gets hurt and we don't have coverage?**
A: Penalties are severe:
- Criminal misdemeanor ($10,000+ fine)
- Civil penalties ($1,000-$25,000)
- Personal liability for all medical costs and lost wages
- Employee can sue directly

**Bottom line: Workers comp is mandatory in Texas with 3+ employees. Don't operate without it.**
